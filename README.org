#+TITLE: Use HAN port to get electricity usage

This is a software engineer playing with KiCad.

I have tried a few approaches but the one that is now active is the
e-meter-han-usb-c variant. It consists of a ESP32 and a USB-C connector as well
as a connector for the HAN port.

Note that this is still work in progress!
